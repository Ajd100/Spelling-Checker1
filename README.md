# Spelling-Checker1
First Spelling Checker - Built in Java

fileChecker_broken.java doesn't work as intended. I left it in the package to showcase the issues I ran into learning about HashMaps.

fileChecker2.java works as intended. It's good to go, it'll compare the file to the dictionary and check for misspelled words

spellChecker.java will take user input and compare it against the dictionary, checking if it is spelled correctly

utilities.java contains the methods to convert a file to an array.
